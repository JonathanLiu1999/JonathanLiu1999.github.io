### This is a simple tutorial on how to construct an interesting data visualization of the the Palmer Penguins data set.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
penguins
```
We first need to import pandas for manipulating data frames and import numpy to operate array computations efficiently, and lastly import matplotlib.pyplot to make plots. I read in the cvs file from the url into a pandas data frame called penguins.

Now, let's explore this data frame with two plots!

```
df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [True, False, False, False], "B": [0, 0, 0, 0]})

df.any(axis = 1)
```
