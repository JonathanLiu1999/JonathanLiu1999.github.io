We first need to import pandas for manipulating data frames and import numpy to operate array computations efficiently, and lastly import matplotlib.pyplot to make plots. I read in the cvs file from the url into a pandas data frame called penguins.

Now, let's explore this data frame by creating a visualization!

```python
import numpy as np
import nbconvert
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd


url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)


```

Preprocessing the data for creating better visualization later and shortening the names of the species


```python
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```

Creating bar plots for each feature of the penguins.

And the features are: "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)","Body Mass (g)","Flipper Length (mm)".

I want a comparison of the features between the three species of the penguins.


```python
X_species = ["Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo"]
```



Groupby helps to group observations by one feature. Here, I selected "Species" because I want to compare different species of penguins.

Find the mean of the four columns (The four features I care about).

And let's take a look of the result of the groupby.




```python
m = penguins.groupby("Species")[["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)","Body Mass (g)","Flipper Length (mm)"]].mean()

m

```

Our visualization includes four base empty plots and change the figsize to give the best visualization
Encoded the name of the columns to easily label the plots inside of the for loop in next step



```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize = (20, 7))

Species_code = {1 : "Culmen Length (mm)",
2 : "Culmen Depth (mm)",
3 : "Body Mass (g)",
4 : "Flipper Length (mm)"}
```

Now, let's complete the plots by filling in the four empty base plots with bar plots!

Loop through each previously created empty base plot, Add the speicies names for the x-axis, and the y-axis is the mean value of the feature corresponds to each plot.

Lastly, Add legends.


```python
for i in Species_codes.keys():
    ax[i-1].bar(X_species ,np.array(m.iloc[:,i-1]),label = Species_codes[i] )
    ax[i-1].legend()

fig
```

I gave one of my peers a cool suggestion! And he said I am a super helpful person. I am pretty happy about that.
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}





These are some fairly preliminary plots. But they still tell us some information about the dataset. For example, we can see that it is obvious that Gentoo specie has a larger Body Mass than the other two species.
