> In this post, I used sqlite3, pandas, plotly and some other useful tools to make interactive plots to give some insight on global warming. Global warming is happening! And we all need to help stop it!



**Import packages**


```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from plotly import express as px
import sqlite3
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from plotly.io import write_html
```

**Build a database**


```python
# create a database in current directory called temps.db
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
# Read in data
df = pd.read_csv("temps.csv")

# Make the dataframe into our desired format
def prepare_df(df):
    """
    The input is a dataframe and the output is a dataframe with proper column names and normalized temperature degree.
    """
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)


df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    # Using a for loop here to send data into database by chunksize of 100000 with modification explained below
    df = prepare_df(df)

    # Here, I added "FIPS" as a new column for the temperature dataframe, namely, df. The reason I did that is to merge this data frame with another one that contains country information later with SQL query.
    df["FIPS"] = df["ID"].str[0:2]
    # I added a new column called "Date", this new column is formed by adding the year and the month columns together and change the format to the standard datetime format.
    df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Year"].astype(str) + "-" + df["Month"].astype(str))
    #send the temperature data to a table called "temperatures" in the database.
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

**Get the countries data and send the countries data into a new table called "countries" in the database.**


```python
countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url)
#Rename the FIPS 10-4 tol FIPS for short, and also I did this to avoid potential problem when doing SQL query.

# send data into database created ealier
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4" : "FIPS","Name" : "Country"})
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```
**Get the stations data and send the stations data into a new table called "stations" in the database.**

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url)

# send data into database created ealier
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

**Verify the data read in from url and CSV file previously are properly sent to and stored in the database.**


```python
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute("SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")

for result in cursor.fetchall():
    print(result[0])

```

    CREATE TABLE "temperatures" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "Year" INTEGER,
      "Month" INTEGER,
      "Temp" REAL,
      "FIPS" TEXT,
      "Date" TIMESTAMP
    )
    CREATE TABLE "countries" (
    "FIPS" TEXT,
      "ISO 3166" TEXT,
      "Country" TEXT
    )
    CREATE TABLE "stations" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "LATITUDE" REAL,
      "LONGITUDE" REAL,
      "STNELEV" REAL,
      "NAME" TEXT
    )


**Write a Query Function**


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    This function accepts four arguments:

    country, a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned.
    year_begin and year_end, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
    month, an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned.

    The return value of query_climate_database() is a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year.
    """

    #SQL command
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, T.temp, S.latitude, S.longitude, T.fips, T.year, T.month, C.country
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON T.FIPS = C.FIPS
    WHERE C.Country = (?) AND T.year >= (?) AND T.year <= (?) AND T.month = (?)
    """

    Result_df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params= (country, year_begin, year_end, month,))
    return (Result_df)


```

I am going to answer the following question visually.

> How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?


```python
def coef(data_group):
    """
    This function used linear regression to find the coefficient corresponds to the slope of the linear relation.
    """
    x = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]   
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0]


def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs,**kwargs):
    """
    This function accepts five explicit arguments, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments. And the five explicit arguments are: country, year_begin, year_end, and month. This function returns an interactive geographic scatterplot that shows how the average yearly change in temperature varys within a given country.
    """

    # I first used query_climate_database function I wrote previously to get a dataset.
    First_DF = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    First_DF["Year_count"] = First_DF.groupby(["NAME","Month"])["Year"].transform(len)
    # Applying filter to get rid off stations that do not have enough years of observation data.
    Second_DF = First_DF[First_DF["Year_count"] >= min_obs]


    coefs = Second_DF .groupby(["NAME"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()


    finalDF = coefs.merge(Second_DF, on = "NAME")
    finalDF = finalDF.rename(columns = {0:"Estimately Yearly Increase Temperature in Celsius"})


    # Graph with scatter_mapbox
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(finalDF,

**Line Plot**

This Plot gives the temperature of all stations from a user-defined country during a user defined time frame. This plot shows throughout the years, how the stations' temperatures have changed. I represent each station of each year's temperature as the average temperature of that station throughout that year (the sum of temperatures from 12 months divides by 12). The plot might seem too overwhelming at first especially when we are looking at a country with many stations. However, one of the nice features of px.line is allowing viewers to click on the names of each line (On the right side of the plot) and make unwanted lines to disappear. This plot is very helpful if one wants to learn the change of temperature of certain stations located in a certain country throughout a certain time frame. I demonstrate the use of my function (temperature_trends_plot) with the data from the stations in India from 1980 to 2020. And only stations with user defined years of observation of temperature data will be included.


```python

**A choropleth is a polygon-based visualization, in which different geographic polygons are assigned different colors.**

GeoJSON's are pretty complex files, fortunately, plotly makes it very easy for us to obtain the geographic information and use it to plot choropleths.



```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json

countries_gj_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/countries.geojson"

with urlopen(countries_gj_url) as response:
    countries_gj = json.load(response)

```

Instead of three, I should have written a single query function that is more functional. Below is the last query function for all the countries. ^warning^ Querying the data alone can be already time consuming for this function, so making the choropleth will be even more time consuming.


```python
def query_climate_database_global(year_begin, year_end):
    """
    This function accepts two arguments:

    year_begin and year_end, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.


    The return value of query_climate_database_global() is a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the world in the specified date range.
    """

    #SQL command
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, T.temp, S.latitude, S.longitude, T.fips, T.year, T.month, C.country
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON T.FIPS = C.FIPS
    WHERE T.year >= (?) AND T.year <= (?)
    """

    Result_df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params= (year_begin, year_end,))
    return (Result_df)

```


```python
# Get all the temperature data for all the countries from year 1900 to 2010

df_global = query_climate_database_global(1990,2010)

# Get the mean temperature for each country during each year
df_global = df_global.groupby(["Country","Year"]).mean().reset_index()
```

**Let's plot!**


```python
fig = px.choropleth(df_global,
                    geojson=countries_gj,
                    locations = "Country",
                    locationmode = "country names",
                    color = "Temp",

                    animation_frame = 'Year',
                    animation_group = 'Country',
                    )

fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
fig.show()

**Close the database connection to prevent unnecessary operations.**


```python
conn.close()
```
