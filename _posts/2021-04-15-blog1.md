Part 1

Build connection with database and get the temperature data


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")

df = pd.read_csv("temps.csv")

# Make the dataframe into our desired format

def prepare_df(df):
    """
    The input is a dataframe and the output is a dataframe with proper column names and normalized temperature degree.
    """
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)


df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    # Using a for loop here to send data into database by chunksize of 100000 with modification explained below
    df = prepare_df(df)

    # Here, I added "FIPS" as a new column for the temperature dataframe, namely, df. The reason I did that is to merge this data frame with another one that contains country information later with SQL query.
    df["FIPS"] = df["ID"].str[0:2]
    # I added a new column called "Date", this new column is formed by adding the year and the month columns together and change the format to the standard datetime format.
    df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Year"].astype(str) + "-" + df["Month"].astype(str))

    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

To get countries data


```python


countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url)
#Rename the FIPS 10-4 tol FIPS for short, and also I did this to avoid potential problem when doing SQL query.

# send data into database created ealier

countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4" : "FIPS","Name" : "Country"})
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

    /opt/anaconda3/envs/PIC16B/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py:2789: UserWarning:

    The spaces in these column names will not be changed. In pandas versions < 0.14, spaces were converted to underscores.



To get stations data


```python

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url)

# send data into database created ealier
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

To verify that the data read in from url and CSV file is properly sent to and stored in data base created earlier.


```python

cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")

for result in cursor.fetchall():
    print(result[0])


```

    CREATE TABLE "temperatures" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "Year" INTEGER,
      "Month" INTEGER,
      "Temp" REAL,
      "FIPS" TEXT,
      "Date" TIMESTAMP
    )
    CREATE TABLE "countries" (
    "FIPS" TEXT,
      "ISO 3166" TEXT,
      "Country" TEXT
    )
    CREATE TABLE "stations" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "LATITUDE" REAL,
      "LONGITUDE" REAL,
      "STNELEV" REAL,
      "NAME" TEXT
    )

Sorry fellow classmates and grader , the internet in my area is down, so I cannot finish this plot. I should have started early on this homework. Sorry.
