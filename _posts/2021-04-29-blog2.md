In this blog post, you'll write a tutorial on a simple version of the *spectral clustering* algorithm for clustering data points. Each of the below parts will pose to you one or more specific tasks. You should plan to both:

- Achieve these tasks using clean, efficient, and well-documented Python and
- Write, in your own words, about how to understand what's going on.  

> Remember, your aim is not just to write and understand the algorithm, but to explain to someone else how they could do the same.

***Note***: your blog post doesn't have to contain a lot of math. It's ok for you to give explanations like "this function is an approximation of this other function according to the math in the assignment."

### Notation

In all the math below:

- Boldface capital letters like $\mathbf{A}$ refer to matrices (2d arrays of numbers).
- Boldface lowercase letters like $\mathbf{v}$ refer to vectors (1d arrays of numbers).
- $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$ refers to a matrix-matrix product (`A@B`). $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}$ refers to a matrix-vector product (`A@v`).

### Comments and Docstrings

You should plan to comment all of your code. Docstrings are not required except in Part G.

## Introduction

In this problem, we'll study *spectral clustering*. Spectral clustering is an important tool for identifying meaningful parts of data sets with complex structure. To start, let's look at an example where we *don't* need spectral clustering.


```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances
from scipy.optimize import minimize, rosen, rosen_der
```


```python
n = 200
np.random.seed(1111)
X, y = datasets.make_blobs(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, random_state=None, centers = 2, cluster_std = 2.0)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
plt.savefig('Intro_pic1.png')
```

*Clustering* refers to the task of separating this data set into the two natural "blobs." K-means is a very common way to achieve this task, which has good performance on circular-ish blobs like these:


```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
plt.savefig('Intro_pic2.png')
```

!['Intro_pic2.png'](/images/Intro_pic2.png)




### Harder Clustering

That was all well and good, but what if our data is "shaped weird"?


```python
np.random.seed(1234)
n = 200
X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.05, random_state=None)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
plt.savefig('Intro_pic3.png')
```


!['Intro_pic3.png'](/images/Intro_pic3.png)




We can still make out two meaningful clusters in the data, but now they aren't blobs but crescents. As before, the Euclidean coordinates of the data points are contained in the matrix `X`, while the labels of each point are contained in `y`. Now k-means won't work so well, because k-means is, by design, looking for circular clusters.


```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
plt.savefig('Intro_pic4.png')
```

!['Intro_pic4.png'](/images/Intro_pic4.png)



Whoops! That's not right!

As we'll see, spectral clustering is able to correctly cluster the two crescents. In the following problems, you will derive and implement spectral clustering.

## Part A

Construct the *similarity matrix* $\mathbf{A}$. $\mathbf{A}$ should be a matrix (2d `np.ndarray`) with shape `(n, n)` (recall that `n` is the number of data points).

When constructing the similarity matrix, use a parameter `epsilon`. Entry `A[i,j]` should be equal to `1` if `X[i]` (the coordinates of data point `i`) is within distance `epsilon` of `X[j]` (the coordinates of data point `j`).

**The diagonal entries `A[i,i]` should all be equal to zero.** The function `np.fill_diagonal()` is a good way to set the values of the diagonal of a matrix.  

#### Note

It is possible to do this manually in a `for`-loop, by testing whether `(X[i] - X[j])**2 < epsilon**2` for each choice of `i` and `j`. This is not recommended! Instead, see if you can find a solution built into `sklearn`. Can you find a function that will compute all the pairwise distances and collect them into an appropriate matrix for you?

For this part, use `epsilon = 0.4`.

> In Part A, I followed Professor's instruction to use euclidean_distances to generate the desired similarity matrix, "A". I demonstrated what "A" looks like below.

```python
def matrix_generator(input_data,epsilon):
    # First find the distance between vectors
    mx = euclidean_distances(input_data, input_data)
    # Turn the entries of the matrix that are smaller than user-defined distance threshold epsilon into 1's, other wise 0's
    mx = 1*(mx < epsilon)
    # Change the diagonal entries to 0s
    np.fill_diagonal(mx,0)

    return mx

A = matrix_generator(X,0.4)

A
```




    array([[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0],
           ...,
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 0]])



## Part B

The matrix `A` now contains information about which points are near (within distance `epsilon`) which other points. We now pose the task of clustering the data points in `X` as the task of partitioning the rows and columns of `A`.

Let $d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}$ be the $i$th row-sum of $\mathbf{A}$, which is also called the *degree* of $i$. Let $C_0$ and $C_1$ be two clusters of the data points. We assume that every data point is in either $C_0$ or $C_1$. The cluster membership as being specified by `y`. We think of `y[i]` as being the label of point `i`. So, if `y[i] = 1`, then point `i` (and therefore row $i$ of $\mathbf{A}$) is an element of cluster $C_1$.  

The *binary norm cut objective* of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is the function

$$N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)\equiv \mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)\left(\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)} + \frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_1)}\right)\;.$$

In this expression,
- $\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0, j \in C_1} a_{ij}$ is the *cut* of the clusters $C_0$ and $C_1$.
- $\mathbf{vol}(C_0) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0}d_i$, where $d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}$ is the *degree* of row $i$ (the total number of all other rows related to row $i$ through $A$). The *volume* of cluster $C_0$ is a measure of the size of the cluster.

A pair of clusters $C_0$ and $C_1$ is considered to be a "good" partition of the data when $N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)$ is small. To see why, let's look at each of the two factors in this objective function separately.


#### B.1 The Cut Term

First, the cut term $\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)$ is the number of nonzero entries in $\mathbf{A}$ that relate points in cluster $C_0$ to points in cluster $C_1$. Saying that this term should be small is the same as saying that points in $C_0$ shouldn't usually be very close to points in $C_1$.

Write a function called `cut(A,y)` to compute the cut term. You can compute it by summing up the entries `A[i,j]` for each pair of points `(i,j)` in different clusters.

It's ok if you use `for`-loops in this function -- we are going to see a more efficient view of this problem soon.

> In Part B 1, I wrote a function called "cut". The cut term in the binary norm cut objective of the input matrix is calculated. And as we can see from below output, the cut objective with true clusters gives us a much smaller value than the with random ones. In Part B 2, I wrote a function called "normcut".  The volume term in the binary norm cut objective of the input matrix is calculated. From the output, we can see that the normcut for the true labels is much smaller compared to the norcut for the fake labels

```python
def cut(A,y):
    # Defind A_sum as 0 to begin with
    A_sum = 0
    # Write for loops to sum up the entries A[i,j] for each pair of points (i,j) in different clusters
    for i in range(len(A)):
        for j in range(len(A)):
            if y[i] != y[j]:
                # Avoid adding twice the value, for example, A[j,i] = A[i,j] and they both will be added, so we mutiply each adding term by 0.5 to avoid this situation
                A_sum = A_sum + 0.5*A[i,j]
    return A_sum


cut(A,y)

```




    13.0



Compute the cut objective for the true clusters `y`. Then, generate a random vector of random labels of length `n`, with each label equal to either 0 or 1. Check the cut objective for the random labels. You should find that the cut objective for the true labels is *much* smaller than the cut objective for the random labels.

This shows that this part of the cut objective indeed favors the true clusters over the random ones.


```python

y_fake = np.random.randint(2, size=200)
cut(A,y_fake)

# As we can see the cut objective with true clusters gives us a much smaller value than the random ones.
```




    1116.0



#### B.2 The Volume Term

Now take a look at the second factor in the norm cut objective. This is the *volume term*. As mentioned above, the *volume* of cluster $C_0$ is a measure of how "big" cluster $C_0$ is. If we choose cluster $C_0$ to be small, then $\mathbf{vol}(C_0)$ will be small and $\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)}$ will be large, leading to an undesirable higher objective value.

Synthesizing, the binary normcut objective asks us to find clusters $C_0$ and $C_1$ such that:

1. There are relatively few entries of $\mathbf{A}$ that join $C_0$ and $C_1$.
2. Neither $C_0$ and $C_1$ are too small.

Write a function called `vols(A,y)` which computes the volumes of $C_0$ and $C_1$, returning them as a tuple. For example, `v0, v1 = vols(A,y)` should result in `v0` holding the volume of cluster `0` and `v1` holding the volume of cluster `1`. Then, write a function called `normcut(A,y)` which uses `cut(A,y)` and `vols(A,y)` to compute the binary normalized cut objective of a matrix `A` with clustering vector `y`.

***Note***: No for-loops in this part. Each of these functions should be implemented in five lines or less.


```python
def vols(A,y):
    Sum_C1 = sum(A[y == 1].sum(axis = 1))
    Sum_C0 = sum(A[y == 0].sum(axis = 1))
    return (Sum_C0,Sum_C1)


def normcut(A,y):
    return cut(A,y) * (1/vols(A,y)[0] + 1/vols(A,y)[1])
```

Now, compare the `normcut` objective using both the true labels `y` and the fake labels you generated above. What do you observe about the normcut for the true labels when compared to the normcut for the fake labels?


```python
normcut(A,y),normcut(A,y_fake)


# The normcut for the true labels is much smaller compared to the norcut for the fake labels
```

## Part C

We have now defined a normalized cut objective which takes small values when the input clusters are (a) joined by relatively few entries in $A$ and (b) not too small. One approach to clustering is to try to find a cluster vector `y` such that `normcut(A,y)` is small. However, this is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, which means that may not be possible to find the best clustering in practical time, even for relatively small data sets. We need a math trick!

Here's the trick: define a new vector $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that:

$$
z_i =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)} &\quad \text{if } y_i = 0 \\
    -\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_1)} &\quad \text{if } y_i = 1 \\
\end{cases}
$$


Note that the signs of  the elements of $\mathbf{z}$ contain all the information from $\mathbf{y}$: if $i$ is in cluster $C_0$, then $y_i = 0$ and $z_i > 0$.

Next, if you like linear algebra, you can show that

$$\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1) = 2\frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}}\;,$$

where $\mathbf{D}$ is the diagonal matrix with nonzero entries $d_{ii} = d_i$, and  where $d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_i$ is the degree (row-sum) from before.  

1. Write a function called `transform(A,y)` to compute the appropriate $\mathbf{z}$ vector given `A` and `y`, using the formula above.
2. Then, check the equation above that relates the matrix product to the normcut objective, by computing each side separately and checking that they are equal.
3. While you're here, also check the identity $\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$, where $\mathbb{1}$ is the vector of `n` ones (i.e. `np.ones(n)`). This identity effectively says that $\mathbf{z}$ should contain roughly as many positive as negative entries.

#### Programming Note

You can compute $\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}$ as `z@D@z`, provided that you have constructed these objects correctly.

#### Note

The equation above is exact, but computer arithmetic is not! `np.isclose(a,b)` is a good way to check if `a` is "close" to `b`, in the sense that they differ by less than the smallest amount that the computer is (by default) able to quantify.

Also, still no for-loops.


```python
# Write a function called transform(A,y) to compute the appropriate  𝐳  vector given A and y

def transform(A,y):
    y = np.where(y == 0, 1/vols(A,y)[0], y)
    y = np.where(y == 1, -1/vols(A,y)[1], y)
    return y


A_sum = A.sum(axis = 1)
D = np.diag(A_sum)
Z= transform(A,y)

# Check if the equation holds
np.isclose((Z.transpose()@(D - A)@Z)/(Z@D@Z),normcut(A,y))

```




    True




```python
# Check if Z.transpose()@D@np.ones(n) equals to zero
np.isclose(Z.transpose()@D@np.ones(n),0)
```




    True



## Part D

In the last part, we saw that the problem of minimizing the normcut objective is mathematically related to the problem of minimizing the function

$$ R_\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{z})\equiv \frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}} $$

subject to the condition $\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$. It's actually possible to bake this condition into the optimization, by substituting for $\mathbf{z}$ the orthogonal complement of $\mathbf{z}$ relative to $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{1}$. In the code below, I define an `orth_obj` function which handles this for you.

Use the `minimize` function from `scipy.optimize` to minimize the function `orth_obj` with respect to $\mathbf{z}$. Note that this computation might take a little while. Explicit optimization can be pretty slow! Give the minimizing vector a name `z_`.


```python
def orth(u, v):
    return (u @ v) / (v @ v) * v

e = np.ones(n)

d = D @ e

def orth_obj(z):
    z_o = z - orth(z, d)
    return (z_o @ (D - A) @ z_o)/(z_o @ D @ z_o)
```


```python
# Use the minimize function from scipy.optimize with minimizing method of TNC to minimize the function orth_obj with respect to 𝐳.
z_ = minimize(orth_obj,Z,method='TNC')
```




**Note**: there's a cheat going on here! We originally specified that the entries of $\mathbf{z}$ should take only one of two values (back in Part C), whereas now we're allowing the entries to have *any* value! This means that we are no longer exactly optimizing the normcut objective, but rather an approximation. This cheat is so common that deserves a name: it is called the *continuous relaxation* of the normcut problem.

## Part E

Recall that, by design, only the sign of `z_min[i]` actually contains information about the cluster label of data point `i`. Plot the original data, using one color for points such that `z_min[i] < 0` and another color for points such that `z_min[i] >= 0`.

Does it look like we came close to correctly clustering the data?

> Indeed, from the plot, the two clusters of data are colored differently. We did pretty good here! Note, here I used a for loop to color each different data point based on the condition if the data point is smaller than zero or not. I thought it was an okay approach until my later plots took me very long time to generate (later plots were made with many more data points), then I realized that for-loop really indeed is very computationally costly. So I avoided this after part F.

```python
z_min = z_.x

np.random.seed(1234)
n = 200
X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.05, random_state=None)

# Color each data point, it is okay to do this here because the data is not that big yet
C_input = ["blue" if z_min[i]<0 else 'red'for i in range(len(z_min))]

# Plot
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c = C_input)

plt.savefig('PartE.png')
```

!['PartE.png'](/images/PartE.png)





## Part F

Explicitly optimizing the orthogonal objective is  *way* too slow to be practical. If spectral clustering required that we do this each time, no one would use it.

The reason that spectral clustering actually matters, and indeed the reason that spectral clustering is called *spectral* clustering, is that we can actually solve the problem from Part E using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.

Recall that what we would like to do is minimize the function

$$ R_\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{z})\equiv \frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}} $$

with respect to $\mathbf{z}$, subject to the condition $\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$.

The Rayleigh-Ritz Theorem states that the minimizing $\mathbf{z}$ must be the solution with smallest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem

$$ (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{z} = \lambda \mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}\;, \quad \mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$$

which is equivalent to the standard eigenvalue problem

$$ \mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{z} = \lambda \mathbf{z}\;, \quad \mathbf{z}^T\mathbb{1} = 0\;.$$

Why is this helpful? Well, $\mathbb{1}$ is actually the eigenvector with smallest eigenvalue of the matrix $\mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})$.

> So, the vector $\mathbf{z}$ that we want must be the eigenvector with  the *second*-smallest eigenvalue.

Construct the matrix $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})$, which is often called the (normalized) *Laplacian* matrix of the similarity matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Find the eigenvector corresponding to its second-smallest eigenvalue, and call it `z_eig`. Then, plot the data again, using the sign of `z_eig` as the color. How did we do?


```python
# Calculate Laplacian matrix of the similarity matrix A
L = np.linalg.inv(D) @ (D-A)

# Find eigenvector that is corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue
Lam, U = np.linalg.eig(L)
ix = Lam.argsort()
z_eig = U[:,ix][:,1]


C_input = ["blue" if z_eig[i]<0 else 'red'for i in range(len(z_eig))]
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c = C_input)

plt.savefig('PartF.png')
```

!['PartF.png'](/images/PartF.png)




In fact, `z_eig` should be proportional to `z_min`, although this won't be exact because minimization has limited precision by default.

## Part G

Synthesize your results from the previous parts. In particular, write a function called `spectral_clustering(X, epsilon)` which takes in the input data `X` (in the same format as Part A) and the distance threshold `epsilon` and performs spectral clustering, returning an array of binary labels indicating whether data point `i` is in group `0` or group `1`. Demonstrate your function using the supplied data from the beginning of the problem.

#### Notes

Despite the fact that this has been a long journey, the final function should be quite short. You should definitely aim to keep your solution under 10, very compact lines.

**In this part only, please supply an informative docstring!**

#### Outline

Given data, you need to:

1. Construct the similarity matrix.
2. Construct the Laplacian matrix.
3. Compute the eigenvector with second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix.
4. Return labels based on this eigenvector.


```python
def spectral_clustering(Data, epsilon):
    """
    The first input of the this function is a 2D array in which each row contains information for (x,y) coordinates for the data.
    The second input is the distance threshold epsilon.

    This function takes on the input data and categorize them into two different groups based on the user-defined distance threshold epsilon.

    The output of the function is an array contains only 1s and 0s. This array contains the binary labels indicating whether data point i is in group 0 and group 1.

    """
    # Construct the similarity matrix
    A = matrix_generator(Data,epsilon)
    A_sum = A.sum(axis = 1)
    D = np.diag(A_sum)
    # Construct the Laplacian matrix
    L = np.linalg.inv(D) @ (D-A)
    Lam, U = np.linalg.eig(L)
    # Compute the eigenvector with second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix
    ix = Lam.argsort()
    z_eig = U[:,ix][:,1]

    #Return labels based on this eigenvector
    return z_eig

```


```python
# The following is  an array of binary labels indicating whether data point i is in group 0 or group 1
Labels = spectral_clustering(X, 0.4)

Labels_forcolor = np.where(Labels < 0, 0, 1)

# Demonstration through plotting
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c = Labels_forcolor )

plt.savefig('PartG.png')
```


!['PartG.png'](/images/PartG.png)



## Part H

Run a few experiments using your function, by generating different data sets using `make_moons`. What happens when you increase the `noise`? Does spectral clustering still find the two half-moon clusters? For these experiments, you may find it useful to increase `n` to `1000` or so -- we can do this now, because of our fast algorithm!


> When noise is increased, the accuracy of the clustering decreased. When noise is 0.1 (doubled), spectral clustering still find the two half-moon clusters pretty well.

```python
# Generating different data sets using make_moons
np.random.seed(1234)
n = 1000
X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.1, random_state=None)

# The following gives an array of binary labels indicating whether data point i is in group 0 or group 1
labels = spectral_clustering(X, 0.4)

# Encode to 0 and 1 based on the condition if the entry is smaller than 0 and use this to supply the color for the plot
Labels_forcolor = np.where(labels < 0, 0, 1)

# Demonstration through plotting
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c = Labels_forcolor)

plt.savefig('PartH.png')
```

!['PartH.png'](/images/PartH.png)






## Part I

Now try your spectral clustering function on another data set -- the bull's eye!


```python
np.random.seed(1111)
n = 1000
X, y = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.05, random_state=None, factor = 0.4)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])

# Epsilon = 0.4


# The following gives an array of binary labels indicating whether data point i is in group 0 or group 1
labels = spectral_clustering(X, 0.4)

# Encode to 0 and 1 based on the condition if the entry is smaller than 0 and use this to supply the color for the plot
Labels_forcolor = np.where(labels < 0, 0, 1)


# Demonstration through plotting
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c = Labels_forcolor)

plt.savefig('PartI_pic1.png')
```


!['PartI_pic1.png'](/images/PartI_pic1.png)



There are two concentric circles. As before k-means will not do well here at all.


```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))


plt.savefig('PartI_pic2.png')
```

!['PartI_pic2.png'](/images/PartI_pic2.png)



Can your function successfully separate the two circles? Some experimentation here with the value of `epsilon` is likely to be required. Try values of `epsilon` between `0` and `1.0` and describe your findings. For roughly what values of `epsilon` are you able to correctly separate the two rings?


> Yes, my function can successfully separate the two circles. I am very proud. When Epsilon = 0.6 and 0.9, my function had difficulty separating the two circles (Only Epsilon = 0.6 is demonstrated below). When Epsilon = 0.4 and 0.1, my function did a good job separating the two circles. The colors labeled for the two groups reversed when Epsilon = 0.4 and 0.1


```python
# Epsilon = 0.1

np.random.seed(1111)

# The following gives an array of binary labels indicating whether data point i is in group 0 or group 1
labels = spectral_clustering(X, 0.1)

# Encode to 0 and 1 based on the condition if the entry is smaller than 0 and use this to supply the color for the plot
Labels_forcolor = np.where(labels < 0, 0, 1)


# Demonstration through plotting
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c = Labels_forcolor)


plt.savefig('PartI_pic3.png')
```


!['PartI_pic3.png'](/images/PartI_pic3.png)




```python
# Epsilon = 0.6

np.random.seed(1111)

# The following gives an array of binary labels indicating whether data point i is in group 0 or group 1
labels = spectral_clustering(X, 0.6)

# Encode to 0 and 1 based on the condition if the entry is smaller than 0 and use this to supply the color for the plot
Labels_forcolor = np.where(labels < 0, 0, 1)


# Demonstration through plotting
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c = Labels_forcolor)


plt.savefig('PartI_pic4.png')
```


!['PartI_pic4.png'](/images/PartI_pic4.png)
