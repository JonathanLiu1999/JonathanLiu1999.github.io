**Reflection on PIC16B Project**

Overall, what did you achieve in your project?

My teammates and I were able to use flask web framework to build a webpage where a user interface with recommendations for housing location are given to form a dataframe according to users' response to questions.

What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of?

I never had any previous experience building a webpage. When I first told my teammates about the idea of creating a webpage, my teammates and I were all very uncertain if we could make it work. We made it work! This is the first project that was completely based on our own design and implementation with little guidance. All the Kaggle projects I did were provided with goals and data. We did everything from scratch and we were able to create something at the end. I am really proud of it. I am also proud of that I was able to realize some of the ideas I thought in my mind for this project with the help from Prof Google and Prof Youtube.


What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.)
The two things I can improve on my project are:
> 1. Creating a forum for users to discuss what they like and dislike about the community they live in.
> 2. Right now, the backend of our webpage reacts somewhat slowly to users' requests. The housing value prediction plots take quite a long time to return. Potentially, we can find an optimized solution for a quicker response to users' inputs. The data we used for our project is fairly small and simple so we did not bother creating a database to use SQL to query the data. If our project were on US Housing and we could find more data associated with geographic information, I believe creating database becomes essential.

How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)

Originally, we wanted to provide more insights and analysis on social inequality aspects of the California Housing market. However, due to a lack of data sources, we could not find much of the data, such as California Economy at a local scale (city and zip code). And, at the very beginning, we set one of the main goals for our project is to build predicative models to predict California Housing. We tried some machine learning models and Neural Network, but the outcomes were not ideal. Therefore, we changed the focus of the project to build a webpage.

What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc?

I learned the following:
> 1. How to use flask to build a backend
> 2. Using Facebook's prophet for the forecasting of time series data

How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible.

Prior to this project, most of my experience with Python were to use it for building machine learning models. From this project, I realized how powerful Python is for other uses besides data analysis. For example, in the past, the functions I wrote in Python were mostly for the purpose of saving myself time and effort to deal with data during analysis. However, in this project, I wrote a function to subset the dataframe according to users' housing preference given our inputs to the questions on the webpage. Users' answers to the questions are saved and used as inputs for the query function to subset the data frame. Then in the end, the output of this function will be returned back to the webpage. To figure out how this works was quite interesting and challenging, but it piqued my interest in building webpages. In the future, I would love to learn more about building and designing webpages.


I want to say thank you to my teammates for being amazing and hardworking. And I want to thank Erin and Professor Chodrow for the help and advice on our project.
